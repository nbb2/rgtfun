RGTFun is a MATLAB app designed for the efficient calculation of scattering integrals and transport coefficients of elastic collisions. This new code features a well designed graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the step by step process of going from an intermolecular potential to macroscopic transport coefficients such as the viscosity and diffusion coefficient. The ethos of the project is to decrease the learning curve of going from quantum chemistry calculations of intermolecular potential energy surfaces to usable transport coefficients in CFD or PIC codes.
