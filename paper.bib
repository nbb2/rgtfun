	abstract = {Total collision cross sections have been measured for helium atoms, with energies between 500 and 2100 ev, scattered in room temperature helium. Measurements were made with two detectors of different geometric aperture, 13.4 and 0.96 minutes. In order to obtain meaningful potential energy information from such results, it is necessary to determine effective apertures by taking into account beam shape, intensity distribution, and for the case where the beam is wider than the detector, scattering to the detector from external regions of the beam. Potential energy functions have been derived from the cross sections obtained with the two detectors. The functions agree within a factor of about 1.3 as compared with 0.17 when geometric apertures are used directly. The results from both detectors have been represented by an average function, namely, V(r)=7.55×10−12/r5.94 ergsfor values of r between 1.27A and 1.59A.
            The potential energy information obtained from the present experiments is in agreement with theoretical calculations of P. Rosen and H. Margenau within the uncertainty of such calculations. The information also appears to be consistent with that derived from measurements of gaseous compressibility and viscosity, for values of r between 1.90A and 2.30A.},

	abstract = {The report contains a set of easy-to-program expressions for the calculation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the five noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and of the 26 binary and multicomponent mixtures that can be formed with them. The properties in question are second virial coefficient B, viscosity η, thermal conductivity λ, self-diffusion and binary diffusion coefficient D, and thermal diffusion factor αT. The calculation of properties is restricted to low densities ( ρ≪B/C) but covers the full range of compositions and a temperature interval extending from absolute zero to the onset of ionization. Owing to the careful theoretical basis on which the algorithm has been erected, all properties are thermodynamically consistent with each other. Reference to a selected set of critically evaluated measurements provides a basis for the estimation of uncertainties. The report contains 54 abbreviated tables of numerical data and 86 deviation plots. It is asserted that the results are comparable to the best measurements that could be performed at present.},
