	abstract = {"Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is the principal lithography technology aiming to manufacture computer chips beyond the current 193-nm-based optical lithography, and recent progress has been made on several fronts: EUV light sources, optics, optics metrology, contamination control, masks and mask handling, and resists. This book covers the fundamental and latest status of all aspects of EUVL in field. It thoroughly covers the current in-field version of EUVL plus related topics, including light sources, optics, mask, photoresists, contamination, imaging and scanners. In the nine years since SPIE Press published the first edition of EUVL Lithography, much progress has taken place in the development of EUVL as the choice technology for NGL. In 2008, EUVL was a prime contender to replace 193 nm based optical lithography in leading edge computer chipmaking, but not everyone was convinced at that point. Switching from 193 nm to 13.5 nm wavelengths was a much bigger jump than the industry had attempted before. It brought several difficult challenges in all areas of lithography - light source, scanner, mask, mask handling, optics, optics metrology, resist, computation, materials and optics contamination. These challenges have been effectively resolved, and several leading-edge chipmakers have announced dates, starting in 2018, for inserting EUVL into high-volume manufacturing"--},

A challenging problem in the development of this technology is the lifetime of collector optics. Mirror surfaces are subjected to harsh debris fluxes of plasma in the form of ions, neutrals, and other radiation, which can damage the surface and degrade reflectivity. This manuscript presents the measurement of debris ion fluxes and energies in absolute units from Xe and Sn EUV sources using a spherical sector ion energy analyzer. Experimentally measured erosion on Xe exposed samples is in good agreement with predicted erosion. This result allows prediction of erosion using measured ion fluxes in experiment. Collector optic lifetime is then calculated for Xe and Sn sources without debris mitigation. Lifetime is predicted as 6h for Xe EUV sources and 34h for Sn EUV sources. This result allows calculation of expected collector optic lifetimes, which can be an important tool in optimizing source operation for high volume manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Generation of debris in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources is an inherent and real threat to the lifetime of collection optics. Debris measurement of these sources is useful to enable source suppliers to estimate collector lifetime. At the Center for Plasma Material Interactions (CPMI) at the University of Illinois, an Illinois calibrated spherical sector electrostatic energy analyzer (ICE) was built to measure the ion debris flux in absolute units. In addition to ion flux, the detector is also capable of identifying different ion species present in the plasma utilizing energy-to-charge ratio discrimination. The lifetime of the collector optics is calculated using the measured ion flux. In the current investigation we compare the measurement of ion debris production in three different EUV sources: the Energetiq EQ-10M, the AIXUV-100, and the XTREME XTS 13-35. In the EQ-10M source, three angular measurements are coupled with three variations in operating pressure to measure consequent effects on debris production. These measurements reveal four predominant ion species in the energetic debris analysis: C+, Si+, Xe+, and Xe2+. The amount of debris is reduced as pressure is increased. Various debris mitigation methods are implemented in the AIXUV-100 source and results reveal that four ion species are observed (Ar+, Xe+, Xe2+, and W+), though there does not seem to be a dominant species. The first mitigation technique, backstreaming argon toward the source, reduces the amount of Ar+, Xe2+, and W+, yet increases the amount of Xe+ The increase in Xe+ flux is explained based on charge exchange phenomena. The ICE machine was then attached 1.92 m away from the pinch of XTS 13-35 source, and placed at 25° away from the normal line. The comparison of results reveals that the XTS 13-35 and the EQ-10M sources produced comparable amounts of energetic ion flux per watt of EUV light produced. The AIXUV-100 source generated more ion debris flux per watt of EUV light than the other two sources, though it should be noted that the AIXUV-100 source was capable of producing more than ten times the amount of EUV light power compared to any of the other sources.},

Currently, development of second-generation laser-produced plasma (LPP) light sources for the ASML’s NXE:3300B EUV scanner is complete, and first units are installed and operational at chipmaker customers. We describe different aspects and performance characteristics of the sources, dose stability results, power scaling, and availability data for EUV sources and also report new development results.},

Special features and procedures used in the experiments include the use of a magnetic field to increase the positive-ion current in the source, acceleration of the positive ions extracted from the source in a region of relatively low pressure with a consequent reduction in their energy spread, production of neutrals by charge transfer in a chamber separated from the scattering chamber, modulation of the neutral beam to produce an ac signal on a compensated thermal detector, and amplification of the detector signal with synchronous rectification, at the modulation frequency, of the amplifier output.
            A detailed analysis of the scattering results treats effect on the measured cross sections of the intensity distribution in the beam and of the beam-detector geometry, interpretation of the results in terms of different empirical monotonic potential functions (the exponential, the screened Coulomb, and the point repelling inverse power), and the effects of quantum scattering.
            Numerical values for the He–He potential between 0.61 and 1.12 Å for the three assumed potential functions show good internal consistency and agree with the best theoretical values within the combined estimates of the maximum uncertainties in the experimental and theoretical values. The mean potential obtained from the three empirical functions may be represented within about 1.8\% by V(r)mean=196 exp(−4.21r) eV; 0.61 Å\&lt;r\&lt;1.12Å.},

	abstract = {Total collision cross sections have been measured for helium atoms, with energies between 500 and 2100 ev, scattered in room temperature helium. Measurements were made with two detectors of different geometric aperture, 13.4 and 0.96 minutes. In order to obtain meaningful potential energy information from such results, it is necessary to determine effective apertures by taking into account beam shape, intensity distribution, and for the case where the beam is wider than the detector, scattering to the detector from external regions of the beam. Potential energy functions have been derived from the cross sections obtained with the two detectors. The functions agree within a factor of about 1.3 as compared with 0.17 when geometric apertures are used directly. The results from both detectors have been represented by an average function, namely, V(r)=7.55×10−12/r5.94 ergsfor values of r between 1.27A and 1.59A.
            The potential energy information obtained from the present experiments is in agreement with theoretical calculations of P. Rosen and H. Margenau within the uncertainty of such calculations. The information also appears to be consistent with that derived from measurements of gaseous compressibility and viscosity, for values of r between 1.90A and 2.30A.},

As the output, the code provides the vibrational quenching, dissociation, and reactive cross sections along with the rovibrational energy distribution of the reaction products. Furthermore, we treat H\$\_2\$ + Ca \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ CaH + H reactions as a prototypical example to illustrate the properties and performance of the software.

Using Boltzmann’s relation, one finds a linear electrostatic potential as a solution of the self-similar expansion. It is first shown that in such a potential, the electron behavior is exactly solvable. As a result, one finds that the exact electron density differs substantially from the Boltzmann equilibrium for moderate values of the self-similar parameter. The complete calculations of the self-similar expansion, without any assumption about the equation of state of the electrons, is presented. It is shown, in particular, that half the electron density depletion in logarithmic units is compensated for by the self-consistent modification of the electric potential. Finally, the effect is analyzed in terms of energy exchange between the electrons and the ions in the expansion.},

	abstract = {A model is proposed for the calculation of viscosity, diffusion, thermal diffusion, and the translational part of the heat conductivity of dilute polar gases. It is assumed that the molecular-collision trajectories are negligibly distorted by transfer of internal rotational energy, and that the relative orientation of two colliding dipoles remains fixed throughout the significant portion of the collision trajectory around the distance of closest approach. For this model, the Chapman-Enskog theory retains its usual form, but the collision integrals which appear must be averaged over all possible relative orientations occurring in collisions. Collision integrals have been calculated for the Stockmayer (12–6–3) potential, [open phi](r)=4ε0[(σ0/r)12−(σ0/r)6+δ(σ0/r)3],for kT/ε0 from zero to 100 and for δ from —2.5 to +2.5, and averaged over all orientations (assumed equally probable). Sufficient collision integrals are tabulated that the convergence error of the Chapman-Enskog theoretical expressions is not a problem.
            Experimental viscosities and dipole moments of a number of polar gases have been used to determine the potential parameters ε0, σ0, and δ, which were then used to calculate other properties for comparison with experiment. The over-all agreement between experiment and this model for polar gases is comparable to that of the Lennard-Jones (12–6) model for nonpolar gases.},

A new application of EUV in lithography was the reason for such a growth. Naturally, an intensive development in such area produces a snowball effect of relatively uncharted phenomena. EUV-induced plasma is one of those. While being produced in the volume of a rarefied gas, it has a direct impact onto optical surfaces and construction materials of lithography machines, and thus has not only scientific peculiarity, but it is also of major interest for the technological application. The current article provides an overview of the existing knowledge regarding EUV-induced plasma characteristics. It describes common, as well as distinguishing, features of it in comparison with other plasmas and discusses its interaction with solid materials. This article will also identify the gaps in the existing knowledge and it will propose ways to bridge them.},

              The general chemical dynamics computer program VENUS is used to perform classical trajectory simulations for large polyatomic systems, with many atoms and complicated potential energy functions. To simulate an ensemble of many trajectories requires a large amount of CPU time. Since each trajectory is independent, it is possible to parallel process a large set of trajectories instead of processing the trajectories by the conventional sequential approach. This enhances the vectorizability of the VENUS program, since the integration of Hamilton's equations of motion and the gradient evaluation, which comprise 97.8\% of the CPU, can each be parallel processed. In this article, the vectorization and ensuing optimization of VENUS on the CRAY‐YMP and IBM‐3090 are presented in terms of both global strategies and technical details. A switching algorithm is designed to enhance the vector performance and to minimize the memory storage. A performance of 140 MFLOPS and a vector/scalar execution rate ratio of 10.6 are observed when this new version of VENUS is used to study the association of CH

It is shown that at least a significant part (25\%) of this discrepancy arises from nonadiabatic effects of high relative angular velocity of the atoms in the collisions typical of the experiment. A perturbation-theory treatment is included to give an estimate of the over-all magnitude of the effect; but a variational calculation is employed with the nonadiabatic Hamiltonian to produce the minimum estimates of nonadiabatic energy shifts to which we refer above. The theory correctly predicts the observed approximate agreement between adiabatic energies and the experimental potentials at larger distances (R=1.06 Å). A method of extending the variational calculation to include continuum contributions is described; it employs a pseudo-Hamiltonian to simplify the calculation. Arguments connected with this formulation are advanced to suggest that when continuum contributions are taken into account it may be possible to account for all or most of the observed discrepancy.},

            The need for accurate calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules is motivated by the opportunities and challenges of such studies. The most commonly used approach for all‐electron electronic structure calculations in general—the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method—is discussed in combination with Gaussian, Slater a.k.a. exponential, and numerical radial functions. Even though LCAO calculations have major benefits, their shortcomings motivate the need for fully numerical approaches based on, for example, finite differences, finite elements, or the discrete variable representation, which are also briefly introduced. Applications of fully numerical approaches for general molecules are briefly reviewed, and their challenges are discussed. It is pointed out that the high level of symmetry present in atoms and diatomic molecules can be exploited to fashion more efficient fully numerical approaches for these special cases, after which it is possible to routinely perform all‐electron Hartree‐Fock and density functional calculations directly at the basis set limit on such systems. Applications of fully numerical approaches to calculations on atoms as well as diatomic molecules are reviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook is given.},

One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2π

Surface wave plasma (SWP) technology developed at Illinois generates hydrogen radicals and ions, resulting in tin etch rates that are high enough to keep extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithographic tools clean. An advantage of an SWP antenna is the ability to generate a high density of hydrogen radicals and hydrogen ions directly at the desired etching location. In situ etching of tin enables high availability EUV tools by maintaining high reflectivity of the multilayer mirror of the collector. Additionally, the SWP is characterized with low ion energies and low electron temperature, such that the multilayer mirror does not suffer any damage from sputtering or implantation of hydrogen ions during operation. Here, experiments elucidating the fundamental processes of tin removal are conducted by varying pressure, power, surface temperature, and gas flow rate in order to observe the etch rate behavior. Our results have shown that the presence of hydrogen ions increases etch rates because ion bombardment weakens Sn–Sn bonds, which, in turn, allows for a higher rate of chemical etching by the radicals. The ion bombardment reduces the number of radicals needed to etch a single tin atom to the range of 102–103. The linear SWP antenna yields plasma densities on the order of 1017to1018m−3 and radical densities on the order of 1018to1019m−3, allowing for greater utilization of ion etch enhancement. Etch rates of up to 200 nm/min have been achieved. The surface temperature of the samples is an important factor in the etching process such that the decrease in the surface temperature increases the etch rates and decreases the hydrogen desorption rates. In addition, a kinetic etch model is developed to explain the behavior of etch rates as a function of surface temperature. Furthermore, results from experiments performed in an Illinois NXE:3100 chamber will be discussed.},

The physicochemical characteristics of this gas, its formation in a plasma process, and its interaction with various materials have not been explored and understood completely. Here, the electron ionization mass spectrum of SnH4 is presented. All ten natural abundance isotopes were observed experimentally for each fragment, i.e., Sn+, SnH+, SnH2+, and SnH3+. Density functional electronic structure theory was used to calculate the optimized ground state geometries of these gas phase species and their relative stabilities and helped explain the absence of SnH4+ in the observed signals. The density of the liquid, its cracking pattern, and the surface morphology of its deposits were examined. The surface of the deposited tin film resulting from the decomposition and subsequent oxidation was characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The main species found at the surface were metallic tin and tin (II) oxide (SnO). The detailed characterization of stannane should help correctly identify it in EUV lithographic processes and develop approaches in the future to mitigate its decomposition and redeposition on the collector mirrors or vacuum chamber walls.},

In the case of the reaction A + A→B + C in which the products B and C are removed and no inert gas is present, the appropriate elastic collision integrals have been evaluated for the model of rigid elastic spheres and the reactive collision integrals have been evaluated for two reaction cross sections, one corresponding to the simple collision theory of bimolecular reactions with activation energy ε* and the other to the “centrifugal barrier” theory of free-radical recombinations. For the activated reactions the detailed results show that the Chapman–Enskog method is useless when the reaction is fast (ε* / kT ≲ 5) because the perturbation method fails and is also useless when the reaction is slow because the Sonine polynomial expansion then diverges, as anticipated by Takayanagi. In free-radical reactions the Chapman–Enskog procedure is satisfactory and the nonequilibrium corrections to the reaction rate are negligibly small (\&lt;0.1\%) in first and second orders.},

In the intervening 25 years, DSMC has become the method of choice for modeling rarefied gas dynamics in a variety of scenarios. The chief barrier to applying DSMC to more dense or even continuum flows is its computational expense compared to continuum computational fluid dynamics methods. The dramatic (nearly billion-fold) increase in speed of the largest supercomputers over the last 30 years has thus been a key enabling factor in using DSMC to model a richer variety of flows, due to the method’s inherent parallelism. We have developed the open-source SPARTA DSMC code with the goal of running DSMC efficiently on the largest machines, both current and future. It is largely an implementation of Bird’s 1994 formulation. Here, we describe algorithms used in SPARTA to enable DSMC to operate in parallel at the scale of many billions of particles or grid cells, or with billions of surface elements. We give a few examples of the kinds of fundamental physics questions and engineering applications that DSMC can address at these scales.},

Rigorous theoretical verification of the model is performed by comparison with exact values of diffusion and viscosity cross sections and related collision integrals. The collision quantities given by the polynomial approximation model agree within 3.5\% with those of the exact LJ scattering. The proposed model is compared in detail with the generalized soft sphere (GSS) model which is the closest in terms of fidelity among existing direct simulation Monte Carlo collision models. The GSS model's performance for the collision integral used in the first approximate of viscosity coefficient is comparable to the proposed model for most reduced temperatures. However, other collision integrals deviate significantly, even at moderate reduced temperatures. The high fidelity of the proposed model at low reduced temperatures enables non-equilibrium simulations of gases with deep LJ potential well such as metallic vapors. The model is based on the scattering angle as opposed to viscosity or diffusion coefficients and provides a direct link to molecular dynamics simulations.},

              . In a previous communication (‘Proc.’, A, vol. 82, 1909, p. 396) the approximate boiling points of a number of metals were determined at atmospheric pressure. Apart from the question of finding the exact relation between the boiling point and pressure, it is an important criterion of any method for fixing the temperatures of ebullition to demonstrate that the experimental values obtained are dependent on the pressure. It is specially desirable when dealing with substances boiling at temperatures above 2000° to have some evidence that the points indicated are true boiling points. Previous work on the vaporisation of metals at different pressures has been confined to experiments in a very high vacuum except for metals like bismuth, cadmium, and zinc, which boil at relatively low temperatures under atmospheric pressure. The observations were limited to very low pressures on account of the difficulty of obtaining any material capable of withstanding a vacuum at temperatures over 1400° and the consequent necessity for keeping the boiling point below this limit by using very low pressures. Moreover in the case of the majority of the metals,
              e. g.
              , copper, tin, ebullition under reduced pressure has never been observed. The difficulties indicated above were avoided by using a similar type of apparatus to that previously described, and arranging the whole furnace inside a vacuum enclosure, thus permitting of the use of graphite crucibles to contain the metal.},

The β–γ–liquid triple point obtained in this work is 3.02 ± 0.05 GPa and 562 ± 2 K. The experimental data and the extrapolated melting curve of the γ phase using the Simon-type equation are in good agreement with the theoretical and most of the experimental results at high pressure.

            Energetic tin ions are created by laser produced plasmas in extreme-ultraviolet lithography sources where hydrogen must be used as a buffer gas to protect critical optical components. In this study, the quantum chemistry code NWChem is used to calculate the interatomic potential between singly ionized tin and molecular hydrogen. The interatomic potential was fit by an inverse-power potential, a modified universal ZBL potential, and a two-piece-Lennard-Jones potential which were in turn used to calculate the classical distance of closest approach, scattering angle, total elastic scattering cross sections. Furthermore, the universal Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) potential was used in the open-source binary collision approximation codes RustBCA as well as Stopping Range in Matter and Transport of Ion in Matter (SRIM/TRIM) to calculate ion ranges, straggling, and stopping cross sections in a hydrogen gas target.},

              Symmetry‐adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is a well‐established method to compute accurate intermolecular interaction energies in terms of physical effects such as electrostatics, induction (polarization), dispersion, and exchange. With many theory levels and variants, and several computer implementations available, closed‐shell SAPT has been applied to produce numerous intermolecular potential energy surfaces for complexes of experimental interest, and to elucidate the interactions in various complexes relevant to catalysis, organic synthesis, and biochemistry. In contrast, the development of SAPT for general open‐shell complexes is still a work in progress. In the last decade, new developments from several research groups, including the author's, have greatly enhanced the capabilities of SAPT. The new and emerging approaches are designed to make SAPT more
              widely applicable
              (including interactions involving multireference systems, complexes in arbitrary spin states, and intramolecular noncovalent interactions), more
              accurate
              (enhanced description of intramolecular correlation, a better account of exchange effects, relativistic SAPT, and explicitly correlated SAPT), and more
              efficient
              (enhanced density‐fitted implementations, linear‐scaling variants, empirical dispersion, and an implementation on graphics processing units). The new developments open up avenues for SAPT applications to an unprecedented variety of weakly interacting complexes.

	abstract = {White dwarfs are stellar embers depleted of nuclear energy sources that cool over billions of years. These stars, which are supported by electron degeneracy pressure, reach densities of 1e7 grams per cubic centimetre in their cores. It has been predicted that a first-order phase transition occurs during white-dwarf cooling, leading to the crystallization of the non-degenerate carbon and oxygen ions in the core, which releases a considerable amount of latent heat and delays the cooling process by about one billion years. However, no direct observational evidence of this effect has been reported so far. Here we report the presence of a pile-up in the cooling sequence of evolving white dwarfs within 100 parsecs of the Sun, determined using photometry and parallax data from the Gaia satellite. Using modelling, we infer that this pile-up arises from the release of latent heat as the cores of the white dwarfs crystallize. In addition to the release of latent heat, we find strong evidence that cooling is further slowed by the liberation of gravitational energy from element sedimentation in the crystallizing cores. Our results describe the energy released by crystallization in strongly coupled Coulomb plasmas, and the measured cooling delays could help to improve the accuracy of methods used to determine the age of stellar populations from white dwarfs.},

The calculation of properties is restricted to low densities ( ρ≪B/C) but covers the full range of compositions and a temperature interval extending from absolute zero to the onset of ionization. Owing to the careful theoretical basis on which the algorithm has been erected, all properties are thermodynamically consistent with each other.
